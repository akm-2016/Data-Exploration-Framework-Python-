Interactive Data Exploration and Analysis (IDEA, as my prof says!!!) or Exploratory Data Analysis (commonly known as EDA) is very important part of data science. It is a critical step required to complete every project regardless of the domain or the type of data you are working with. An interactive graphical method is a cherry on the cake which helps business to gain insights as well as to generate new hypothesis from dataset. This process helps transform datasets into useful information that help decision makers to make informed
decisions.

This whole process can be divided into 4 phases before you can start analysis or model building.
1. Data consolidation - Collect, select and integrate the data
2. Data cleaning - Impute values, reduce noice, eliminate duplicates
3. Data transformation - Normalize data, discritise data, create attributes
4. Data reduction - Reduce dimension, reduce volume, balance data

### So let's get started !!!
